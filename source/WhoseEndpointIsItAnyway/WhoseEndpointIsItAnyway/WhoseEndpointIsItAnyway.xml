            <summary>
            The rank of this address, as follows: 0 - WAN; 1 and 2 - Probably what you want; 3 - Might be what you want, but probably infrastructure for virtual machines or something similar; 4 - most definitely infrastructure for virtual machines or something similar; 5 - link local addresses; 6 - something wrong, don't use it

            <summary>
            Gets you the friendly neighborhood endpoint that you probably want to use in most scenarios

            <remarks>The WAN address is only going to be returned if the device is not behind a router or anything else that'd get thet address. Also some ISPs NAT the users, so even when the device is directly connected "to the internet" it stil might not get a WAN address.</remarks>
